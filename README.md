**BIBLEAPP**

👋 Hi, I’m @TateImce


**DESCRIPTION**

This a fun little straight forward web app that draws values from bible json files and displays them on the page. The script is done using vanilla javascript and styling with bootstrap.

**SHOUT OUT**

A special acknowledgement to the Bible Super Search site at https://www.biblesupersearch.com for the free json files.

This program is just an exercise that I needed to do, but if you are interested let me know, perhaps I can improve on it.
