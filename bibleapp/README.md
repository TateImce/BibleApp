# BIBLEAPP

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TateImce<br>

**DESCRIPTION** <br>
This a fun little straight forward web app that asynchronously draws data from bible json files and displays them on the page. The script is done using vanilla JavaScript and styling with bootstrap. It is just an exercise that I needed to do, but if you are interested let me know, perhaps I can improve on it.<br>

**SHOUT OUT**<br>
A special acknowledgement to the Bible Super Search site at https://www.biblesupersearch.com for the free json files.<br>
